"""Live wiring for the extensibility primitives (spec 16) into the loop.

The extensibility slice shipped the *loaders + config + gate registration*
but deferred the seams that plug them into a running ``carve plan`` /
``carve build``. This module is those seams, in one place so the plan
flow, the build flow, and delegated subagents all wire identically:

* :func:`build_extensibility_hook_factory` — load ``carve/hooks.toml``
  *once* (a missing file is fine → no hooks) and return a **factory**:
  ``(mode) -> (pre_tool_hook, post_tool_hook)`` that builds the
  :class:`HookRunner` (and its bash gate) **at the mode it is called
  with**. The factory is the seam that keeps a hook clamped to the mode of
  *whatever loop fires it* — the top-level run at its own mode, a delegated
  subagent at its (narrower) ``child_mode``.
* :func:`build_extensibility_hooks` — the eager convenience over the
  factory: build the ``(pre, post)`` for a single, fixed mode. The plan
  flow (``plan``) and the build flow (``build``) call this directly because
  their loop runs at exactly one mode and never re-clamps.
* :func:`build_skill_pack_tool` — the ``lookup_skill_pack`` content
  -injection tool, so description-matched packs are discoverable at
  runtime.
* :func:`resolve_agent_or_fallback` — route through the classification
  router (``select_agent``) when a declarative agent matches, and **fall
  back** to the caller's hardcoded dispatch (return ``None``) when none
  does. ``builtin/`` is empty until later increments, so the fallback is
  what preserves the M1 extract-load plan/build flow unchanged.

Why the mode is *passed to the factory at fire-build time* rather than
baked once: the run already knows its mode (plan runs at ``plan``, build at
``build``), and the hook runner must be gated at *that* floor — a hook in a
plan run must not reach write/network bash. But a **delegated subagent**
runs at ``min(parent_mode, capability)`` — *narrower* than its parent — and
a hook that fires inside the child must be clamped to the **child's**
authority, never the parent's. Baking a single mode into a pre-built
closure (the old shape) escalated a child hook to the parent's mode; the
factory re-derives the gate at ``child_mode`` instead, so the clamp is
inherited from *whichever* loop fires the hook.
