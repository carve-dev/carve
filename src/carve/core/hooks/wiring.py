"""Wire declarative hooks into the loop's ``pre_tool``/``post_tool`` seam.

:func:`build_tool_hooks` turns a list of :class:`HookSpec` + a
:class:`HookRunner` into the two ``Hook`` callables ``AgentLoop`` accepts
(``pre_tool_hook`` / ``post_tool_hook``). Each callable, when the loop
fires it for a tool call:

1. selects the specs subscribed to that event whose ``match`` matches the
   call (tool name + ``bash`` command glob),
2. runs each via the :class:`HookRunner` (gated + clamped + fail-closed).

The loop order is **gate → pre_tool → execute → post_tool**
(``loop.py``), so a ``pre_tool`` hook fires **after** the gate has already
admitted the call: it can only **further-restrict** (raise to abort),
never enable a denied call. A :class:`HookExecutionError` propagates out
of the callable; the loop catches a raising hook and turns it into a
tool-call abort.

:func:`build_post_build_hook` is the **lifecycle** analogue for
``post_build``. A lifecycle hook takes the event payload (no tool/command)
rather than ``(tool_name, tool_input)``, expands the payload keys into the
command, and runs each matching spec through the *same* gated
:class:`HookRunner`. The difference from a tool hook is **when** it fires
and what a raise means: ``post_build`` fires **after** the ``Build`` row is
durably recorded, so the build flow treats a raising hook as
surfaced-not-rolled-back (post-commit), not an abort — the gate still
clamps/denies the command exactly as for a tool hook, but the Build stands.
